Making whatever you develop faster, more intuitive, powerful and reliable. But things move fast and it can be challenging to keep up. Google Developer Groups help you learn from your peers, find out what\u2019s new and share ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>GDG Reading &amp; Thames Valley</b>&nbsp;has several sub-groups:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>[WebDev]:</b>&nbsp;JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, libraries, frameworks and tools for building modern Web applications such as AngularJS, Chrome, Charts, Material Design, PWA,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; As technologies are increasingly converging we also include&nbsp;Android development and mobile integration.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>\n<p><b>[Cloud]</b>:&nbsp;A platform for cloud based services such as: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service and Software as a Service. Google Cloud Platform&nbsp;includes App Engine, Firebase, Actions, Compute Engine, Bigquery (Big Data), Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Kubernetes, Functions etc...</p>\n<p><b>[IoT]</b><span>: Android Things&nbsp;</span><span>and other connected device APIs&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>[ML]</b>:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Tensorflow &amp; Keras, Cloud ML, Data tools on GCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Although these are our core areas we do not limit ourselves exclusively to them.&nbsp; You may also find events on wider web, cloud and api technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\n<p><span>We also provide regular hackathons, workshops, Study Jams and all day DevFests.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Come and speak for us</b></span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15Fg9kaj4WLs5Jj5Kbl8aijWxpnKEhVFmQNvOYiGz2Kg/edit\">Speaker request form</a><br></span></p>\n<p><b>Let\u2019s Build a Community&nbsp;</b> <br></p>\n<p>GDG Reading and Thames Valley&nbsp;meets at least monthly in Reading at our various sponsored venue locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Our meetings will where possible be free and open to the general public. We believe in community and work where possible with Universities, Business Schools, Technical Colleges and Companies in the area. We often co-host with other developer and technical skills groups - Java, Python, Javascript, DataScience, Biotech etc. We like to help Not for Profit Groups and Charities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Don\u2019t be frightened&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Developers aren\u2019t all experienced full-time employees for enterprise companies - often they are business people trying to design better websites, create an app or get on the cloud. And we all have to learn - students are very welcome and we can help you gain valuable business experience as well as technical skills. Last but not least - we advise on methods and products we believe are best, not necessarily to maximise sales of Google products or services.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Follow us:</b> <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdgreading\">Twitter</a> <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gdgreadinguk/\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0nZUldcH1GVWcEs_b2_wHQ\">GDG Reading YouTube</a> <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/b/114875932755046206016\">Google+</a> <br></p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: GDG Reading and Thames Valley is an independent group; our activities and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google, the corporation</i><span>. <i>To learn more about the GDG program, visit&nbsp;</i></span><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/groups/\"><i>https://developers.google.com/groups/</i></a> <br> <br></p>",
